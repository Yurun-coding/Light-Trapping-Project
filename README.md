# Light-Trapping-Project
This repo contains the code for my senior research project "A Parameterization Method for Light Trapping in Silicon Solar Cells".
[ReadImage.py](ReadImage.py) retrieves the pixel values from the image, finds the centroid of the image (the brightest spot), and makes a histogram of intensity (pixel values) vs radius.
